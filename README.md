## Semantic HTML Implementation

The project uses Semantic HTML to improve website accessibility and SEO. HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` provide a clear document structure for both users and search engines. This approach improves readability, allows screen readers to interpret the content more effectively, and enhances inclusivity.
